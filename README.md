# Area Characterisation  for Area based Approach

## Problem Statement 

Recent displacement trends show growing numbers of displaced population living outside of designated areas such as camp/camp like setting (traditional camps collective/transit/reception centres, informal settlements) with a majority setting in dispersed locations predominately urban and peri-urban areas such as informal settlements, unfinished buildings or interspersed in host community homes and communities, shared rooms or rental arrangements. To be able to reach, properly assess and understand local dynamics, vulnerabilities and capacities of the displaced and host populations alike, humanitarian organisations are increasingly using sub-national [Area Based Approach](https://www.humanitarianlibrary.org/collection/implementing-area-based-approaches). Area based approaches define “_an area, rather than a sector or target group, as a primary entry point_”. Such approach is particularly appropriate when residents in an affected area face complex, inter-related and multisectoral needs, resulting in risk of forced displacement.
